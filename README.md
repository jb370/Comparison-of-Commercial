Data for Paper: Comparison of Commercial LLM Models
These are the results from the application of the three Commercial LLMs on the original data and the translated data.

The Original-Langauge-Results folder contains the results for each LLM model saved in individual excel files with each 
sheet in the file as the results from each language, with their sentiment evaluated by the LLM without translation.

The Translated-Results folder contains the results for the translated to English results, with each excel file containing the 
original text and its translation to English with Google Translate, with each sheet in the Excel file showing the results
of the sentiment analysis conducted by each Commercial LLM.
